/*
Creating our First react Component 
React Component is a reusable piece of code , more like a building block which helps breaking down complex UI into smaller more manageable pieces.

MY POV: Components are those "<Footer />" which helps add that footer component to any page desired.

function WelcomeMessage() {
  return (
    Hello React 👋
    This is my first component.

  );
}
export default WelcomeMessage;
